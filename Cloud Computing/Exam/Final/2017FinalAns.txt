Question 1: Define the Following:

a)Scalability:
 =>The degree to which the system will remain effective when there is increase in the number of resource and thr number of users.
 =>Ability of a system to handle an increase in amount of load.	
	
b)Jugle Computing:
 =>Combination of heterogeneous , hierarical and distributed computing resource.

c)Migration Services:


d)Emulation:
 => A system pretends to be another system.

e) Virtualization:
 =>It is a technology to run multiple same or diffirent OSs on a single Physical Machine which are completely isolated from each other.


 
 Question 2:What is the relation between the following:
 
 a) Location transparency and Availability:
  =>User can access resource without knowledge of its location
   eg, URL therfor this url should have high Availability.
   
 b)Public cloud and Private cloud:
  =>They are both types of deployment in the cloud.
    They could be part of the hybrid cloud.
	
 c)Migration and Green ICT:
  =>Migration free up space and reduce power which is better for the environment.
  
  d) Cloud CAP-EX and OP-EX:
   =>They are both Benefits of virtualization over cloud computing.
   => Can be done with server consolidation
   
 e) VM migration and SLA:
  => Migration could increase down time and deacrease Performance ,which violates SLA.
  => If a VM is consuming more than its fair share of resource , it will be eligble for this machine
  to be moved to another underutilized host or assign for resources for it if available.
	
 f) VM Migration and On-Demand Computing:
  =>Workload monitoring and migrating is done without human interaction.


Question 3: What is the Similarities and Differences:

a)P2P Computing and Grid Computing:
 SIM => P2P is the infrastructrue of Grid. / Both are distributed systems.
 Differences => P2P is free and Decentralized , grid is pay as you use and Centralized
 
 
 
b)Over Provisioning and Under Provisioning:
Sim => Both should be avoided.
Diff => over: allocating more resource than required,
 under: Allocating fewer resoures than required.
 
 
 c) Regular Migration and Live Migration:
  Sim=>Both are from VM migration technique.
  Diff=> Regular:VM is completely powered off before migration , no shared memory.
     Live: VM is Powered on while migrating , Requrie shared memory.

d) Full , Para and OS Virtualization:
Sim=> They are all types of virtualization Hypervisor.
Diff=> Full: Hypervisor is sitting on the Hardware directly , No Host OS
  Para:Hypervisor is sitting on Host OS , each vm has separate OS
   OS:Known as Containerzation , doesn't require a separate OS.
   

e)Process Migration and VM migration:
